// React has a build process
// The code you write is not the code that gets executed in the browser it gets transformed first
// Raw, unprocessed react code won't execute in the browser as react uses JSX - JSX is HTML written in JS files.
// JSX is not a default JS feature
// React code gets transformed into something the browser can recognise before being sent to the browser
// React code would not be optimised for production without a build process eg not minified
// create-react-app or vite already come with build processes and transformers included in thier packages

// Node.js is used to install packages with the npm command and create projects with npx command and is also used behind the scenes with the build processes
